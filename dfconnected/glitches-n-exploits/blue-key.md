# Blue Key / Dog Room Exploit
Blue key exploit — also known as the Dog Room exploit or the Dog Shrine bug — is an exploit where players are able to obtain a blue master quest key in the Dog Shrine room.
This exploit was found by a Deleted User playing DF CONNECTED v2.1.0 at April 12th (GMT+0) in the #df-chat channel.
## The Exploit
To perform this exploit, you must first complete the Alpha Ruins master quest, and obtain the green key. 
The green key should unlock the grey door in Snowdin Inn's second floor. 
Inside, there is a broken dog shrine as seen in Undertale's Nintendo Switch port.
Although, you are not able to go inside as RickyG said that the dog shrine master quest is unfinished.

By using the Chara vessels, you are able to slide in the bottom right of the map and go to the door of the shrine.
Turns out this also works by using other vessels that has a small hitbox too.
There could be a possibility that RickyG forgot to cover up a tiny hole on the collision walls.

Entering the shrine leads you to a void full of faceless dogs, and a pathway made out of gold-colored dots.
There is also a dog castle which its gate is closed. Inspecting the gate reveals that an ancient artifact is required to open the gate.
The objective is that the player must find the odd ones out of the many faceless dogs.
In the first room, to the top left, there is an annoying dog with a face. Interacting with the dog gives you the ancient artifact.
Go back to the gate, and it will open after interacting.

Inside, there will be a room full of pillars. One of the pillars had a save point, and in the end of the room is where the blue key reside.
It is confirmed by RickyG that before you're able to obtain the key, there will be a guard dog bossfight encounter. But that isn't the case yet at the time.

After obtaining the key, you also earn a trophy-shaped medal.

## Backstory
Many thought that it was just someone messing with the offline mode save files, but it is later proven by Cactsun that this exploit works in Online mode.
The DF Team caught of the news and began telling everyone to not tell anyone on how to do this exploit.
Many people in the Discord server listened, but there are still lots of in-game players who kindly explains how they do it.
Noticing how many players are actively trying this exploit, the DF teams are telling everyone that teaching someone how to do this counts as a 2 weeks ban-able offense.


The DF Team patched the blue key exploit in v2.2.0 and v2.2.1, by removing them from everyone's key slots and blocking the way out to obtain the blue key.
This change also removed the 2 weeks ban rules, but everyone could still perform the exploit by sitting on top of the Dog Shrine's roof.
In version 2.4.0, the Dog Shrine is removed, but instead, the players are greeted with a sign that says `* This is all of Master Quest for now...`

In version 2.5.0, the grey door in the Snowdin Inn is removed entirely.

The Dog Shrine map has actually been around since the first version of Undertale: Don't Forget Story Mode. And was first discovered by krizzy496 in DFSM Ch.1 v1.2.0.
